# C++ Projects Repository

👋 Welcome to my C++ Projects Repository!   
This repository contains a collection of C++ projects that I built for practice, learning, and academic purposes.

##  Folder Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:

- `main.cpp`: The entry point of the project.
- `.h` and `.cpp` files: Organized by class for modularity.
- Optional `README.md`: Explaining the individual project.

##  Concepts Covered

These projects cover a wide range of C++ topics, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Encapsulation & Abstraction
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Basic Data Structures
- Algorithms & Problem Solving

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- IDEs: Visual Studio / VS Code
- Build System: g++ / MSVC
